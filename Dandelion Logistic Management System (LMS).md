## Dandelion Logistic Management System (LMS)

- My FYP

- A software system that manages the pickup and delivery of packages in the real world.

  A package (or parcel). I prefer the term "package" in my project.

- Two modes of delivery: 

  - recipient-to-recipient (you send me something / I send you something, no warehouse/depot)
  - warehouse-to-recipient (postal office/dandelion HQ wants to send you something) 

- Two corresponding web applications:

  - Recipient/customer application
  - Administrator application (also doing user management)

- Let's take a look at how they work in the reality.
